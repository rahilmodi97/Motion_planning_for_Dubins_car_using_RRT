# Motion_planning_for_Dubins_car_using_RRT
To create a roadmap of a non-holonomic car like Dubin’s from initial to goal state using RRT
MOTION PLANNING OF DUBINS CAR WITH RRT

Contributors (Alphabetically): Ashit Mohanty, Huzefa Shabbir Hussain Kagalwala, Rahil Modi & Rakshitaa Geetha Mohan.

In this project we have implemented RRT planning algorithm on a Dubin’s car which consists of 6 curves LRL, RLR, LSR, RSL, LSL & RSR.
When you run the python file you will asked to put in inputs for start position and the goal position coordinates. If they lie on an obstacle you will asked to renter, the coordinates.

The repository also consists of the report and presentation we submitted.
